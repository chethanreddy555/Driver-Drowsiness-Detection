# Driver-Drowsiness-Detection
OpenCV This repo can detect and track user's eyes and mouth and alert when the user is feeling drowsy. Driver drowsiness detection is a car safety Technology which helps prevent accidents caused by the driver getting drowsy.
#######
The project involves direct utilization of the Dlib library's facial landmark detector, specifically the 68-point facial landmark model. This model is robustly trained and efficiently detects key points on the human face. These detected landmarks are crucial for determining whether a person's eyes are open or closed.
